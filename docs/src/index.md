# Overview

This package provides sampling methods for commonly used quantum states in various quantum phase-space representations, including Glauber-P, Positive-P, HusimiQ, and Wigner distributions.

There are also convenience methods for calculating operator averages from phase-space averages, and for sampling noises for solving SDEs in [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
