```julia
samples = reject(P,w,N,Pmax)
```
Sample a probability distribution by rejection sampling over a finite window.

`P` is the probability distribution, normalized to 1.

`w=[w1,w2]` is the window for sampling.

`N` is number of samples.

`Pmax` is a numerical upper bound for `P`: `max(P) â‰¦ Pmax`.
